        <p>
            Known as "D-Wade" or "Flash," Dwyane Wade was born in 1982 in Chicago, Illinois. 
            Wade has played for the Miami Heat, as a shooting guard, since 2003. He is a 
            three-time NBA champion (2006, 2012 and 2013), all with the Miami Heat. In June 2012, 
            Wade—along with power player LeBron James—helped the team to a 121-106 win against 
            the Oklahoma City Thunder, in the fifth game of the NBA finals. 
            The following year, he and the Heat clinched a second consecutive title - this time 
            taking on the San Antonio Spurs. Among various honors, Dwade was named to the NBA 
            All-Rookie First Team in 2004, and was named the 2006 NBA finals MVP and the 2010
             NBA All-Star Game MVP.
